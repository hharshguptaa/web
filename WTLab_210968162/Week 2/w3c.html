        <h2 id="About">About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 to ensure the long-term growth of the Web.
            From the start the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been an international multi-stakeholder community where member organizations,
            a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop open web standards. Led by Interim CEO Ralph Swick and a Board of Directors,
            the Web Consortium's mission is to lead the web to its full potential.

        <h2 id="community">W3C Community</h2>
        <p>W3C's global standards constitute the toolkit for web solutions that scale, enabling innovators to solve hard problems, providing the 
            proper foundations to meet requirements for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security on the web.
            Standards that meet the varied needs of society are created not by one company but through the work of the Web Consortium community:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Members:</b> More than 400 Members from around the world lead the development and implementation of standards.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Staff:</b> W3C is a public-interest non-profit organization whose revenues come primarily from Membership dues. These and some grants support a staff of about 50 people.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Developers:</b> Over 12,000 developers worldwide participate in the standards development.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <h2 id="advantages">Some of our unique advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Open standards that make a difference:</b>Our community has developed several hundreds of open standards that have enabled the creation of two billion websites,
                    the emergence of flourishing business ecosystems, and made the Web accessible to more people, inclusive, and secure.
                </li>
                <li><b>Royalty-free to boost adoption:</b>W3C standards may be used by anyone at no cost: if they were not free, developers would ignore them.</li>
                <li><b>Built-in inclusivity:</b>W3C technologies and guidelines make it possible for people with disabilities to access the web. The web supports communication in many 
                    of the world's languages and writing systems.</li>
                <li><b>Securing the web:</b>W3C standards improve web security through the development of authentication technologies that can replace weak passwords and reduce phishing
                    and other sophisticated cyberattacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2 id="development">W3C standard development process</h2>
        <p>The proven standards development process upheld at the Web Consortium promotes fairness and enables progress.</p>
        <p>Our standards work is accomplished in the open, under the W3C Process Document and royalty-free W3C Patent Policy, with input from the broader community. Decisions are 
            taken by consensus. Technical direction and Recommendations require review by W3C Members - large and small. The Advisory Board guides the community-driven enhancement of the 
            Process Document. The Technical Architecture Group is our highest authority on technical matters.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2 id="participation">International Participation</h2>
        <p>W3C conducts its work primarily in English. Organizations located all over the world and involved in many different fields join W3C as Members to participate in a vendor-neutral forum for the creation of Web standards. W3C Members and a dedicated full-time staff of experts have earned W3C international recognition for contributions to the Web. W3C's global efforts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Liaisons with national, regional and international organizations around the globe. These contacts help W3C maintain a culture of global participation in the development of the World Wide Web. W3C coordinates particularly closely with other organizations that are developing standards for the Web or Internet in order to enable clear progress.</li>
            <li>The W3C Chapters Program, which promotes adoption of W3C recommendations among developers, application builders, and standards setters, and encourage inclusions of stakeholder organizations in the creation of future standards by joining W3C.</li>
            <li>Translations of Web standards and other materials from dedicated volunteers in the W3C community. W3C also has a policy for authorized translations of W3C materials. Authorized W3C Translations can be used for official purposes in languages other than English.</li>
            <li>Talks around the world in a variety of languages on Web standards by people closely involved in the creation of the standards.</li>
            <li>W3C's Internationalization activity helps ensure that the Web is available to people.</li>
        </ul>
