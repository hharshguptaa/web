    <h2 id="about">About W3C</h2>
    <p>The W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. The organization's purpose is to develop open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. W3C operates under a unique consensus-based process, involving both its member organizations and the public, to develop standards and guidelines for the Web.</p>

    <h2 id="standards">Web Standards</h2>
    <p>W3C develops technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and to earn endorsement by W3C and its Members. Some of the well-known standards developed by W3C include HTML, CSS, and XML.</p>

    <h2 id="membership">Membership</h2>
    <p>W3C Membership is open to all types of organizations, including commercial, educational, governmental, and non-profit. Members participate in the development of Web standards by joining W3C Working Groups and Interest Groups.</p>
